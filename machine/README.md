# Machine Parts

The machine design & part files are a fork of the machine from [bdring](https://github.com/bdring/StringArt)

## Modifications
I used a Dremel 100 for the spindle instead of a regular spindle. So, I printed this attachment to hold the Dremel 100: [Dremel 100 Holder](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3757798). I'm not suitable for modifying the 3D part, so I just drilled the holes at the same place as the one in the spindle holder from `bdring.`

Also, I didn't use the gears for the Spindle holder and the needle holder. Instead, I used the metal arm from the servo motor and some thick wire to conduct the movement.


# String Machine
